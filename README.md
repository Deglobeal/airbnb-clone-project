## Technology Stack

Django: Forms the application core with MTV architecture, handling URL routing, middleware processing, and view logic

MySQL: Stores relational data including users, listings, bookings, and payments with transaction support

GraphQL: Serves as the primary API layer enabling clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request

Docker: Containerizes the application ensuring consistent environments from development to production

GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment workflows triggered by code changes

JWT/OAuth2: Secures API endpoints and enables social login integrations (Google, Facebook)

Redis: Improves performance through caching and enables real-time booking notifications

Nginx: Acts as the entry point handling SSL encryption and distributing traffic to backend services


## Database Design

The database schema follows a relational model with ACID compliance. Key entities and relationships:

### Entities and Fields
| Entity | Important Fields | Description |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **User** | `id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `user_type` (host/guest), `created_at` | Platform users with RBAC permissions |
| **Property** | `id`, `host_id` (FK‚ÜíUser), `title`, `price_per_night`, `location`, `amenities` | Rental listings with availability calendar |
| **Booking** | `id`, `property_id` (FK‚ÜíProperty), `guest_id` (FK‚ÜíUser), `check_in`, `check_out`, `total_price`, `status` | Reservation transactions with date constraints |
| **Review** | `id`, `booking_id` (FK‚ÜíBooking), `rating` (1-5), `comment`, `created_at` | User feedback tied to completed bookings |
| **Payment** | `id`, `booking_id` (FK‚ÜíBooking), `amount`, `payment_method`, `transaction_status`, `receipt_url` | Financial transaction records |


## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Handles user authentication, profiles, and role-based access control. Implements secure registration/login flows with email verification and password recovery. Differentiates between hosts and guests with granular permissions, enabling platform interactions while protecting sensitive operations.

### 2. Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings. Includes media uploads, availability calendars, and pricing configurations. Provides CRUD operations for listing details while enforcing ownership verification to prevent unauthorized modifications.

### 3. Booking System
Manages reservation lifecycle from inquiry to completion. Handles date availability checks, pricing calculations, and conflict prevention. Integrates real-time calendar updates and notifications to ensure booking integrity across user interactions.

### 4. Review & Ratings
Enables guests to leave feedback on completed stays and hosts to respond. Calculates aggregate property ratings and displays user reviews. Ensures review authenticity by linking to verified bookings only, maintaining platform trustworthiness.

### 5. Payment Processing
Securely handles financial transactions using payment gateway integration. Manages payment statuses, refunds, and receipts. Encrypts sensitive data and implements PCI-DSS compliant workflows for booking confirmations and host payouts.

### 6. Search & Discovery
Provides location-based property filtering with map integration. Implements keyword search, date/price filters, and relevance sorting. Uses caching mechanisms to deliver fast search results while handling complex geo-spatial queries.

### 7. Messaging System
Facilitates communication between guests and hosts regarding bookings. Supports real-time notifications and message history. Enables platform-mediated communication to protect user privacy while maintaining transaction context.

### 8. Admin Dashboard
Offers moderation tools for user management, content oversight, and analytics. Provides system health monitoring and reporting. Allows authorized personnel to resolve disputes and maintain platform quality standards.


## API Security

### Core Security Measures
1. **Authentication**  
   JWT-based token authentication for all API endpoints.  
   *Why crucial*: Verifies user identity before granting access to sensitive operations like account modifications or payment processing.

2. **Authorization**  
   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with OAuth2 scopes.  
   *Why crucial*: Ensures users can only perform actions permitted to their role (guest/host/admin), preventing unauthorized property edits or data access.

3. **Rate Limiting**  
   Throttling (100 requests/min per IP) using Redis counters.  
   *Why crucial*: Protects against brute force attacks and DDoS attempts, maintaining API availability for booking operations.

4. **Input Validation**  
   Strict schema validation for all GraphQL mutations and REST payloads.  
   *Why crucial*: Prevents SQL injection and NoSQL injection attacks targeting property listings and user data.

5. **HTTPS Enforcement**  
   TLS 1.3 encryption for all data in transit.  
   *Why crucial*: Encrypts sensitive information like payment details and credentials during transmission.

6. **Security Headers**  
   CSP, X-XSS-Protection, and HSTS headers via middleware.  
   *Why crucial*: Mitigates cross-site scripting attacks that could compromise user sessions.


## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) automate the software delivery process. CI automatically builds and tests code changes, while CD automates deployment to production environments. This pipeline ensures rapid, reliable releases with minimal manual intervention.

### Why CI/CD is Crucial for This Project
1. **Quality Assurance**: Catches bugs early through automated testing before they reach production  
2. **Deployment Reliability**: Eliminates human error in deployment processes for critical booking operations  
3. **Rapid Iteration**: Enables frequent feature releases while maintaining system stability  
4. **Rollback Safety**: Provides instant fallback to previous versions if deployment fails  
5. **Environment Consistency**: Ensures identical configurations from development to production
