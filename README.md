# airbnb-clone-project

## üåç Project Overview

This project simulates the development of a full-scale booking platform inspired by Airbnb. Focused on backend systems, database architecture, and secure API development, it provides hands-on experience in building production-ready applications with modern technologies.

- User authentication and profile management
- Property listing creation and browsing
- Booking functionality
- Messaging between hosts and guests
- Payment simulation


- ## üéØ Project Goals

- Implement collaborative team workflows via GitHub
- Design scalable backend architecture
- Develop secure RESTful APIs
- Create optimized database schemas
- Establish CI/CD pipelines
- Produce comprehensive documentation
- Learn and implement a full-stack web app with Django and React
- Apply clean architecture and RESTful API principles
- Deploy a scalable and secure application
- Practice real-world software development workflows

## Technology Stack

Django: Forms the application core with MTV architecture, handling URL routing, middleware processing, and view logic

MySQL: Stores relational data including users, listings, bookings, and payments with transaction support

GraphQL: Serves as the primary API layer enabling clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request

Docker: Containerizes the application ensuring consistent environments from development to production

GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment workflows triggered by code changes

JWT/OAuth2: Secures API endpoints and enables social login integrations (Google, Facebook)

Redis: Improves performance through caching and enables real-time booking notifications

Nginx: Acts as the entry point handling SSL encryption and distributing traffic to backend services
